Board# Hello

One of my goal in this year (2022) to learn something new with my skill as Frontend Engineer, so I decide to learn game dev using frontend stack.

So, this repo work to record my learning progress.

### What I do?

I want to re-make my childhood game (gunbound) but in web version, it make my learning path straight to gunbound function and feature.

If you interested to my learning progress, look at this [Project board](https://github.com/users/afrianjunior/projects/1). In the future, maybe I will write some posts to explain what I doing.
